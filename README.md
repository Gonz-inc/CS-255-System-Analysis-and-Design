# CS-255 System Analysis and Design.
Gerardo Gonzalez.
Southern New Hampshire University. 

## About. 
In this repository, I will attach documents that will demonstrate the skill I have acquired.

Some Skills Include. 
* System Analysis.
* Learning from system backgrounds. 
* Determining functional and non-functional requirements.
* Constructing documentation to meet the client's needs. 
 
## Course reflection.:mag_right: 
* To briefly summarize the DriverPass project we begin with the clients. The clients here are Liam the owner ofthe product and Ian is his IT officer. They purposed an information system that is intended for individuals who are going through the process of acquiring their driver's license. In this system, the operations are designed to create a system that lets these students sign up for additional content as well as in-person training with driving instructors.
<p>

* What I did particularly well was interpreting the client's needs and constructing important requirements in order to meet the client's needs. After I determined the requirements create diagrams that reflect these needs and create diagrams that will help construct the product's system during the integration cycle in the SDLC.
<p>

* If I could revise one part of these documents I would improve the Business Application document by simplifying all the data diagrams and system requirements. 
<p>

* I interpreted the user's needs by creating diagrams of what they wanted in their system and prioritizing different parts of the system according to what was wanted most important to them as well as setting up limitations on what can be developed during the initial planning and design cycle. It's important they consider the needs of the client when designing a system because it shows business integrity which will lead to higher satisfaction with the end product.

* During the integration cycle code would be developed by taking the initial approach with an agile methodology. One approach I took was using Class UML diagrams which help create a comparison and focal point for the developers to create functions and methods that will meet the client's needs. Using this approach in the future will help me by having the diagrams server as a blueprint which helps start the initial process during an agile sprint.
